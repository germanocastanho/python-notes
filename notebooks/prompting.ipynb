      "Okay, imagine you’re playing a game with a pretend robot friend that can answer questions or tell stories. To get the best answers, you can use three simple tricks:\n",

      "1. **Give the robot a little story first (provide context).**  \n",
      "   *Think of it like telling your friend where you are and what you’re doing before you ask a question.*  \n",
      "   Example: “I’m in the kitchen and I see a big, red apple.”  \n",
      "   This helps the robot know what you’re talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tell the robot exactly what you want (be specific).**  \n",
      "   *Instead of saying “Tell me something,” say “Tell me a story about a brave rabbit that eats carrots.”*  \n",
      "   The clearer you are, the better the robot can answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Keep the conversation going (build on the conversation).**  \n",
      "   *After the robot answers, you can ask a follow‑up question that uses what it just said.*  \n",
      "   Example: “What did the rabbit do after eating the carrots?”  \n",
      "   This makes the chat feel like a real back‑and‑forth talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, just remember: give a little background, ask clearly, and keep chatting about what the robot says. That’s how you get the best answers from your robot friend!\n"
