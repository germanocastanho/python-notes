      "Key points\n",
      "- Designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
      "- Interpreted and dynamically typed (you don’t declare variable types).\n",
      "- Uses indentation to define code blocks, which encourages readable code.\n",
      "- Multi-paradigm: supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
      "- Memory-managed (garbage-collected).\n",
      "- Open source (Python Software Foundation) with a large standard library and a huge ecosystem of third‑party packages (PyPI).\n",
      "\n",
      "Why people use it\n",
      "- Easy to learn and read — good for beginners.\n",
      "- Fast development speed — great for scripting, automation, prototypes.\n",
      "- Strong libraries and frameworks for web development (Django, Flask), data science and machine learning (NumPy, pandas, scikit‑learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), scientific computing, automation, DevOps, and more.\n",
      "- Widely used in academia and industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common implementations\n",
      "- CPython (the reference implementation, most common).\n",
      "- PyPy (JIT-compiled, often faster for long-running programs).\n",
      "- Jython (runs on the JVM), IronPython (on .NET).\n",
      "\n",
      "Versions\n",
      "- Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020. Use Python 3 (latest stable minor version at time of writing is 3.x).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiny example\n",
      "- Hello world:\n",
      "  print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
      "- Simple function and list comprehension:\n",
      "  def squares(n): return [i*i for i in range(n)]\n",
      "\n",
      "How to get started\n",
      "- Install from python.org or use Anaconda/Miniconda if you plan to do data science.\n",
      "- Learn the basics from the official tutorial (docs.python.org), or books like “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.”\n",
